NO SUPPORTED PROVIDED FOR RACKINIT WHATSOEVER, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

If using this you can check rack network connectivity before an Initial Install
or as a pre-check to Streaming Expansion (expanding new Streaming clusters into
an existing ENM or adding more nodes to existing Streaming clusters)

If using this before an Initial Install there's no need to use the
--cp/--cobbler_profile option, a temporary one will be created.

If using this as a pre-check for Expansion use "-cp LITP". This will reuse the
existing cobbler distro/profile generated by LITP.
